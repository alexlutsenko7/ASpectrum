# ASpectrum — ZX Spectrum 128K on the QMTECH Cyclone IV (EP4CE15) board

Prototype hardware: QMTECH EP4CE15F23C8N core board + the user's QM_Atrix I/O adapter
(adapter J2 plugged into U8, J1 wired to U7; pin tables in `../docs/BOARD_PINOUT.md`).
Architecture and decisions: `../docs/PLAN.md`, CPU clock-enable analysis: `../docs/T80_CEN_ANALYSIS.md`.

## What it is

| Part | Implementation |
|---|---|
| CPU | T80 (MiSTer @af0e6723, `../T80/`) in `cpu_t80` (single clock enable), 3.5469 MHz, or 28 MHz while the SD tape loader plays or saves (F6: normal speed) |
| System clock | 112 MHz (sys_pll); CPU stepped by a phase accumulator; SDRAM stalls hold the clock enable (turbo only) |
| RAM + ROM | W9825G6KH SDRAM via `sdram_ram` (DDR_TEST, proven at 112 MHz): RAM pages 0-7, ROM 0/1, DiagROM |
| ROMs | in the configuration flash at 0x100000 (in the .jic), copied to SDRAM at power-up/reset by `rom_loader` (~14 ms) |
| Video | 640x480@60 (25 MHz) or 720x576@50 (27 MHz) VGA, 2-bit RGB, from block-RAM shadows of pages 5/7 |
| Sound | AY-3-8912 (JT49, GPL-3) at 1.7734 MHz -> sigma-delta on AUDIO_AY; beeper on AUDIO_BEEPER; the same mix as I2S (`bt_i2s`) to the ESP32, which sends it to Bluetooth headphones / speakers (`esp32/`) |
| Keyboard | USB keyboard via the CH9350-style UART module (115200), packet format as the DE10-Lite reference |
| Joystick | Kempston (port 1F) |
| Tape | SD tape loader (EAR = loader while it plays, else the beeper) |
| SD tape loader | ESP32 system controller (`esp32/`) with the microSD card, over an SPI link (`rtl/esp_link.v`) to the FPGA's loader hardware (`rtl/tape_loader.v`): OSD file browser (320 entries), plays .tap/.tzx T-state exact, records SAVE output into .tap files; turbo or normal speed; .z80 snapshots: F2 saves, the browser loads (`../docs/SD_TAPE_LOADER.md`) |

## Controls

| Control | Function |
|---|---|
| KEY0 (W13) | reset: CPU, ports, ROM reload, tape loader (the ESP32 restarts, Bluetooth reconnects). The video mode is kept. |
| Ctrl+Alt+Del | reset of the Spectrum only (the tape loader keeps running) |
| F1 | **held while the CPU starts** (power-up, KEY0, Ctrl+Alt+Del): DiagROM instead of the 128K ROM |
| F3 | Bluetooth audio menu: scan, connect, PIN, volume; F3 / Esc closes |
| F8 | swap 60/50 Hz video. Power-up default is 640x480@60 (accepted by every monitor; 576p50 is not). |
| F12 / keypad / / NumLock | SD tape loader browser (keys: `../docs/SD_TAPE_LOADER.md`); keypad 5 / F11 pause-continue, keypad - back one block, F7 / keypad * stop. First browser line [Save to this folder]: name, then recording until F12 |
| F6 | tape speed for loading and saving: turbo (default) / normal |
| F2 | save a snapshot of the whole machine: type a name, Enter -> NAME.Z80 in the browser's current folder. Load: F12, choose the .z80, Enter |
| KEY1 (Y13) | not used |
| LED | on = turbo; fast blink = no ROM image in the flash (program the .jic) |

Keyboard: letters, digits, Enter, Space; Left Shift = CAPS SHIFT; Right Shift / Ctrl = SYMBOL SHIFT;
Backspace = DELETE, arrows = cursor keys, Esc = BREAK. While the tape browser is open the Spectrum sees no keys.
At power-up the CPU waits for the first keyboard packet (at most 1.5 s) so a held F1 is seen.

## Build and program

```
quartus_sh --flow compile ASpectrum
quartus_cpf -c ASpectrum.cof                 # -> output_files/ASpectrum.jic (bitstream + ROMs)
arduino-cli compile -b esp32:esp32:esp32 -u -p COM10 esp32     # ESP32: loader + Bluetooth (esp32/README.md)
```
The loader firmware runs on the ESP32: after changing `esp32/`, only the ESP32 is flashed again.
Program `output_files/ASpectrum.jic` once (Programmer, JTAG, Program/Configure, power-cycle): it puts the
ROMs into the flash. After that, `.sof` loads over JTAG are enough during development (ROMs stay in flash).
If the LED blinks fast after loading a .sof, the flash has no ROM image: program the .jic.

## Known limitations

- Memory contention at Level 1 only (memory and I/O cycles, not the internal contended T-states of some
  instructions); the floating bus follows Fuse 1.6 (byte at the start of the I/O cycle's 4th T-state, after its
  contention; fixed 2026-10-11, Sidewize / Arkanoid / Cobra work). No ULA snow. Border effects line up only in
  the 50 Hz mode (PgUp/PgDn move the interrupt). Current list: `../docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.
- Keyboard module UART direction not confirmed: both lines are inputs with pull-ups, RX = KBD_A AND KBD_B
  (works whichever line carries the data). Nothing is sent to the module.
- The ESP32 (`esp32/README.md`, `../docs/ASpectrum_Connection.docx`) is needed for the SD card, the browser and
  Bluetooth; without it the Spectrum boots and runs, but F12 does nothing.
- Joystick and AY/beeper audio need the J1 -> U7 wiring. The adapter's 50/60 switch S1 is not used (D2 unassigned).
